        <h3>Unit Leader</h3>
        <div class="description">
          My research goal is uncovering how hippocampal circuits produce memory and how they are disrupted in neurological diseases. My unique background in both theoretical physics and clinical medicine enables me to employ innovative yet rigorous approaches towards tackling this crucial problem. I obtained an MD and a PhD in theoretical physics, advised by Tom Lubensky, from the University of Pennsylvania. I became a Miller Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley and worked with Mike DeWeese at the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience. Now I'm trying to find opportunities to play piano and beach volleyball in Tokyo.
