          We study how neural circuits in the hippocampal region enable us to remember events along with where they occurred. To do so, we use a variety of theoretical techniques, including neural network simulations and mathematical analysis. We aim to uncover how these circuits are disrupted in neurological diseases such as dementia and epilepsy.
