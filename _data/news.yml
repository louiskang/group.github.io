- title: Neural Circuits and Computations Unit begins
  date: 2020-08-01
  text: Welcome to the Neural Circuits and Computations Unit! Louis is excited to start his own research group in computational neuroscience at RIKEN Center for Brain Science. More to come soon.

- title: Topological data analysis preprint on bioRxiv
  date: 2020-10-08
  text: Read our preprint <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.328773v1">&ldquo;State space discovery in spatial representation circuits with persistent cohomology&rdquo;</a> to bioRxiv. This project explores and characterizes how topological data analysis can be applied to neuroscience data. It is a collaboration with computational topologists Dmitriy Morozov and Boyan Xu at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

- title: Raymond Wang joins as an undergraduate intern
  date: 2020-11-01
  text: Raymond, an undergraduate from University of California, Berkeley, officially joins the group as an intern. He has been working with Louis since March. He is studying how noise in continuous attractor networks produce errors in path integration and methods of suppressing these errors. Welcome!

- title: Topological data analysis paper published in Frontiers
  date: 2021-04-08
  text: Our paper <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.616748">&ldquo;Evaluating state space discovery by persistent cohomology in the spatial representation system&rdquo;</a> is now published in Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience! It is a collaboration with computational topologists Dmitriy Morozov and Boyan Xu at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. We have improved upon our preprint with more rigorous analyses that have produced more impactful conclusions.
