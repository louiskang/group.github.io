  about: My research goal is uncovering how hippocampal circuits produce memory and how they are disrupted in neurological diseases. My unique background in both theoretical physics and clinical medicine enables me to employ innovative yet rigorous approaches towards tackling this crucial problem. Now I'm trying to find opportunities to play piano and beach volleyball in Tokyo.

  about: I am a nonlinear dynamics researcher with a focus on coupled oscillators and excitable systems. Currently, I am studying the dynamics of seizures in neuronal models to expand our knowledge about the dynamics of epileptic states. My research builds upon a combination of mathematical modeling, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis.
